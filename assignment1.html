<h2>HTML</h2>
<h3><a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/html/">HTMLDog</a></h3>
<p>htmldog.com is a website offering easy to understand HTML5 tutorials. The tutorials
are basic enough for the complete novice yet progress to offer quite advanced techniques for the experienced 
user. HTML5dog.com has a systematic approach while teaching the tutorials, they start with the basics and in a 
step by step way teach you HTML5. I found it very helpful to be able to read through the tutorial completely 
without being disturbed by offers to practice what I have learned. All in all, htmldog.com is a good resource 
for the complete beginner to get an overview of HTML5 in a timely, basic, easy way.
</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcademy</a></h3>
<p>codeacademy.com has quite an interesting approach to HTML5 tutorials. Instead of giving you page after page 
of straight HTML5, the main focus is for the user to practice what they have learned as they go. They have, on 
the left pane, instructions on learning HTML5. On the right pane, there is a large window that allows you to 
type in what you have learned and it will display the result of the entered code. I feel this is a very good 
website for someone if they have gone through a few other tutorials. I found it a bit overwhelming for the 
first time user. Also, you must make an account which could be a deterrent to some.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">W3Schools</a></h3>
<p>w3schools.com has the most well rounded approach to learning HTML5. Their approach is simple, the main focus 
is on learning HTML5 then at the bottom of each page is the code window that allows you to try what you have 
learned. They cover everything that you need to know to make an HTML5 website, including how to save a file in 
.html format. This tutorial was my personal favorite because they did not force you to try what you have 
learned nor did they exclude the option but both were incorporated with the correct balance.</p>
<h2>CSS</h2>
<h3><a href="http://htmldog.com/guides/css/">HTMLDog</a></h3>
<p>As with the HTML5 tutorial, the CSS tutorial from htmldog.com has little variance. 
It allows the learner to start at the very beginning of CSS and slowly build your way to a very advanced state. 
The tutorial allows you to go at your own pace while teaching you CSS step by step. I like htmldog.com for 
learning CSS because it is very simple and easy to use but teaches you everything that you need to know about 
it.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/">W3Schools</a></h3>
<p>w3schools.com comes through again with concerning CSS. The CSS tutorial is the same as their HTML5 one but 
they teach you CSS instead. The tutorial starts at the top of the page with it teaching you the syntax of CSS 
with examples, then offers you an opportunity at the bottom of the page to try it out yourself. I like this 
tutorial very much because it teaches you in a clear, concise manner and lets you practice what you have 
learned at the end.</p>
